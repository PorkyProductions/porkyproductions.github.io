                Our story begins in 2017, when our founders, Tristan and Ryan met in school.
                They became friends and eventually discorvered that they could make a website using the "Google Sites" service.
                What better thing to make a website about than a hedgehog pencil sharpener that Tristan had brought to school and named "Porky".
                After this website (PorkyPictures.inc) was created, many other websites followed such as PorkySchool.edu, PorkyPizza.eat, and <abbr title="PorkyBlackHolesThatWillDestroyTheEntireUniverseSoYouProbablyShouldntUseThe.com.com.inc">PBHTWDTEUSYPSUT.c.c.i</abbr>
                At this point, Porky had developed a cult following. But unfortunately, a disgusting hater of porky stole the pencil sharpener, and destroyed it.
                During his last moments, Porky transferred into a Hedgehog plush, where he resides to this day.
                Later on, the old websites were archived, and consolidated into one company, called PorkyProductions, which is the wonderful website you are visiting today.
