                Our story begins in 2017, when our founders, Tristan and Ryan met in school.
                They became friends and eventually discorvered that they could make a website using the "Google Sites" service.
                What better thing to make a website about than a hedgehog pencil sharpener that Tristan had brought to school and named "Porky".
                After this website (PorkyPictures.inc) was created, many other websites followed such as PorkySchool.edu, PorkyPizza.eat, and <br>
                PorkyBlackHolesThatWill-
                <br>DestroyTheEntireUniverse- <br>
                SoYouProbablyShouldnt- <br>
                UseThem.com.com.inc <br>
                At this point, Porky had developed a cult following. But then, sadly, a hater of porky stole the pencil sharpener, and destroyed it.
                However, at the last moment, Porky transferred into a Hedgehog plush, where it resides to this day.
                Later on, the old websites were archived, and consolidated into one company, called PorkyProductions, which is where we are today.
